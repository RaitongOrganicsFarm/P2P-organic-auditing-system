# P2P-organic-auditing-system

So, for anyone that wants to know more about what we've been up to lately, we've been developing a new organic auditing system that's built on a peer-to-peer model. Basically, it's a massively disruptive system that puts the power back into hands of consumers and farmers, rather than "outsourcing" trust to centralised "independent" bodies that are essentially gatekeepers to trade barriers, and which provide increasingly questionable value to the producers and consumers. Our new system will allow farmers to audit farmers, and consumers to audit farmers, in a system that's transparent, accountable and operates in real-time, and draws inspiration from the successful Certified Naturally Grown system already being implemented in the US, but which makes use of 21st century technology.

The idea is to use Open Source software wherever possible, and post the source-code up online for anyone to have a look at. And, while we're currently the instigators and developers of this system, it'll eventually be decentralised from our own server and end up being "owned" and verified by everyone involved, much in the way that BitCoin blockchains and torrents function.

We're currently mapping out all the farms we work with to begin populating the system with baseline data. In addition, we're developing a farm audit questionnaire (which is also being developed as a smartphone app at the same time) that will be based on stringent organic standards (Revision 1 is currently in development, which will then be posted online and to farmers for crowd-sourcing inputs for further revisions). On top of this, we're developing a tiered system for farmers (and perhaps fisherfolk in the future) to enter into and operate within the organic standards, so you as a consumer knows where they're at in terms of organic-ness and why. And we're also looking into various ways to put all this up online in real-time and in a highly user-friendly GUI for both farmers and consumers.

There's a lot more behind this all, so if you want to know more, please ask here in FB, email us at p2p@raitongorganicsfarm.com or come visit us at our digs at 1940 Sukhumvit Road. And if you'd like to volunteer to be a part of this exciting development, we'd love to hear from you!

And last but not least, a special shoutout to @hermes.huang for helping us out with this!
